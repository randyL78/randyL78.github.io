        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Some things I enjoy doing on a regular basis are flying drones, playing golf, and watching TV shows and movies based off of Marvel and DC comic book characters.  I also enjoy cooking when I don't have to clean up. </p>

        <p>I love and hang out with my daughter, my cat Zoe, and my chicken Ruby. While there aren't too many things that can be done with a guy, a nine year old girl, a cat, and a chicken all together we manage to still have fun.</p>

        <h2>Typical Day</h2>
        <p>A Typical day for me involves first getting up... It's the hardest part! After that I get my daughter ready for school and
        get myself ready for work for my cleaning business, Sparklean. After spending most of the day stripping floors or cleaning 
        toilets (yech!) I come home and handle the administrative side of running a business.</p>
        <p>Whew! Sparklean is done for the day. Now it's time to spend some play time with my daughter as well as help with any homework
        thats due. After that it's on the computer again to work towards my techdegree.  Do that for a couple hours, maybe fly a drone 
        or two on breaks, and then it's dinner time.</p>
        <p>After dinner it's study some more until DC on CW time. My daughter and I keep up with <em>Arrow</em>, <em>Flash</em>, <em>Supergirl</em>, and <em>Legends of Tomorrow</em></p>

        <p>After TV, it's time to head to bed and get ready to do it all over again the next day.</p>
